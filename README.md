# Velocity Server Switch

The Velocity Powered Proxy includes a command to allow the player to switch between servers, but the command does not actually exist on the servers themselves. This cauces issues when you'd like to run the command through another source like a MCF or a command block.

This mod adds a command that does exist on the server and can be used like any other command, but emulate the functionally of the Velocity Proxy server switch command: `/velocityserverswitch <servername>`
